<h2>Fitting a Need</h2>
  
<p>It all began with plug-ins.</p>
 
<p>In early 1996, Netscape Navigator allowed developers to customize the browser's functionality with plug-ins. After a plug-in was manually installed by a user, a website could then perform cool, new features. A plug-in might let the user be able to play video or listen to sound. However, in the era of dial up, computers and internet connections couldn't handle such advanced technology. Many users were using 28.8 kbps connections to the internet, which is about 500 times slower than internet connections in 2015. With that slow of a connection speed, it was difficult to even download a plug-in.</p>

<p>There were several plug-ins available, but they all had their downfalls.  Macromedia's Shockwave Player, for instance, "caused web pages to run very slowly and required users to go into their computer preferences and bump up [Netscape] Navigator's RAM requirements so that Shockwave sites would run without error. Needless to say, this was well beyond the capabilities of the average first-time web surfer (Ankerson 261)."</p>

<p>Selecting which plug-in was best for users was difficult. With a few choices, but numerous downfalls, no matter what was selected "...there might have been (and there may yet be) another choice. Yet, decisions about technology, whether in development or in use, are not boundless: they are constrained by the historical, material, and cultural circumstances surrounding them (Haas 222)." With new internet users and slow download speeds, there wasn't a good choice for a web animation plug-in in early 1996. Something more lightweight was needed. </p>
 
 <h2>The Chosen One: FutureSplash</h2>
 
 <p>In the summer of 1996, a San Diego based startup named FutureWave Software Inc. created an animation tool called FutureSplash Animator. Originally intended to be used with a failed pen-based operating system, FutureWave Software found themselves without a home for their newly developed animation tool (Ankerson 323). This program was retooled for existing computer systems, and a plug-in to view animations was made for Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer ("MSN"). This technology was quickly picked up by major companies hoping to add animation to their websites, such as Microsoft's new internet channel MSN.</p>
 
 <p>"'MSN is committed to using the best Internet technologies to build entertaining multimedia Web pages for our customers. FutureSplash Animator is not only easy to use, but the small file sizes mean that we can give our members a richer online experience with graphics and animation,' said Tom Firman, director of technology for the Microsoft Network ("MSN")." The small file size and clarity of FutureSplash was very appealing to companies. It meant customers didn't have to wait a long time or put too much effort into watching web animation: "vector-based drawings and animations can be embedded in Web pages using FutureSplash Player. This new player technology allows consumers to view drawings and animations even over a conventional modem line ("MSN")."</p>
 
 <p>Macromedia purchased FutureWave Software Inc. in January 1997, giving them ownership of FutureSplash Animator. "Rather than develop Internet-specific multimedia technology from scratch, Macromedia folded FutureSplash into its product line, calling it Macromedia Flash. Macromedia has positioned Flash as a low-end tool and expects developers to continue to use Shockwave for more advanced interactive development (Levitt)."</p>

 
 <h2>The Flash Boom</h2>
 
 <p>Flash became the most adopted vector animation tool on the internet, but it was not as useful to users with slow internet connections. Downloading the Flash plug-in was a time consuming process. Knowing this, Macromedia set out to make sure Flash was available to a vast majority of users ("NETSCAPE").</p>
 
 <p>In June 1998, Netscape announced that Flash would be included with its browser. "'This is a significant breakthrough for consumers who want to experience rich, interactive web content in today's low-bandwidth environment,' said Rob Burgess, chief executive officer of Macromedia. 'Leading Internet destinations such as the Olympic Committee, Sony Camcorders Europe, South Park, Suzuki, The X Files, and more already use Flash to create eye-catching graphics and animation. Now web consumers can enjoy these destination sites -- even when surfing the net with standard 28.8 modems -- without having to download a plug-in. Our partnership with Netscape is an important step in our mission to add life to the web ("NETSCAPE").'"</p>
 
 <p>Flash continued to be heavily downloaded. In July 1998, "daily downloads of the Shockwave and Flash players... [grew at] a rate of 310,000 per day, totaling more than 93 million downloads worldwide ("Macromedia Shockwave")." At the same time, Macromedia announced that Shockwave and Flash players "are pre-installed with every copy of Microsoft's newly released Windows 98 operating system. Without downloads, rich media content is now instantly available for millions of users ("Macromedia Shockwave")." By 1999, there were over 100 million people running Flash, or 77 percent of Web consumers ("Macromedia: Macromedia").</p>
 
 <p>With its widespread use and distribution, Flash became a tool users were expected to have. It was the most logical tool to pick for companies, since the most people would be able to view the content. It was also the most accessible tool for consumers who didn't need to waste their time downloading and installing a plug-in. Companies began integrating Flash more and more into their websites, not only to make their websites more attractive, but to make their websites more usable.</p>
