<h2>A Slight Confrontation</h2>
<p>Adobe saw the future was heading towards a device diverse internet. People would be connecting to the internet in a variety of ways, and the intenet should work from all of those ways. While the company was more than willing to head towards the future, not everyone else was not willing to let them. Apple released their new smartphone, the iPhone, without the ability to use Flash.</p>

<p>Apple justified their decisions in <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/" target=_blank>Steve Job's Thoughts on Flash</a>. In this letter, Jobs asserts that, "[at Apple,] we strongly believe that all standards pertaining to the web should be open. Rather than use Flash, Apple has adopted HTML5, CSS and JavaScript - all open standards. Apple's mobile devices all ship with high performance, low power implementations of these open standards. HTML5, the new web standard that has been adopted by Apple, Google and many others, lets web developers create advanced graphics, typography, animations and transitions without relying on third party browser plug-ins (like Flash).... [Furthermore,] most Flash websites will need to be rewritten to support touch-based devices. If developers need to rewrite their Flash websites, why not use modern technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript?"</p>

<p>Adobe responded with a public ad campaign claiming Apple was limiting the choices of customers (featured to the right). The co-founders of Adobe also wrote a response to Steve Jobs titled 'Our Thoughts on Open Markets.' In it, they focus on claims that certain publisher or types of content should never be blocked. "We believe that consumers should be able to freely access their favorite content and applications, regardless of what computer they have, what browser they like, or what device suits their needs. No company -- no matter how big or how creative -- should dictate what you can create, how you create it, or what you can experience on the web." </p>

<h2>Why not use Modern Technologies?</h2>

<p>Jobs undaunted outlook for new web technologies has a well-founded root. Why use a third party application when code built into the browser will work? Jobs was a few years ahead of his time as many companies had not yet adopted to these new practices in 2010. But they would, perhaps with motivation from the decision to exclude Flash from a popular mobile device.</p>

<p>Adobe attempted to make Flash more usable for the internet, while ignoring that the internet was getting more usable without Flash. The tool originally made the internet more usable-- It was the lightweight, interactive, cross-browser compatiable tool the internet needed. But that need was now disappearing.</p>
