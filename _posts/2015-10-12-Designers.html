<h2>Wars of Incompatability</h2>

<p>It was the time of the Browser Wars. Browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator were in fierce competition with each other to win the majority of users. One weapon they used against one another were features. By offering features such as frames, colored backgrounds and extra text formatting browser creators hoped that the majorty of users would prefer their product (Windrum, 97). However, this was extremely hard on developers.</p>

<p>Browsers were not using the same code as one another to display webpages in order to have these special features. "...[I]ndependent content providers could in principal[sic] write versions for both browser platforms, this was an expensive option. More likely, they would choose to optimize their content for one or the other browser platforms. (Windrum, 97)" Since the code used to build websites wasn't similar, it became nescessary to find a way to develop sites for all browsers. In order to make their sites usable to more people, many content providers turned to Flash.</p>

<p>"By producing websites entirely in Flash, designers could solve the technical problem of 'cross browser compatibility' by creating a single website that displayed uniformly across multiple browser versions. Furthermore, the vector files Flash created made full-screen, high-resolution motion graphics possible for a fraction of the file size as a bitmapped imageâ€”which meant the technology could be used to efficiently deliver a rich media experience to modem users.... Unlike HTML, Flash offered total control over typography and screen space. (Ankerson, 263)" Many users could experience these rich-media sites since Flash was available to so many people. Companys could have an impressive display for their services, and designers had the ability to make whatever they wanted.</p>
