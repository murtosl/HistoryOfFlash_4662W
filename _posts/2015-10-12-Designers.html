<h2>Skipping the Intro</h2>

<p>Though the web was often used to sell products through text, if a business wanted to present a presentation to their customer, it still had to be with face-to-face contact or through video. However, most video formats were far too large to be streamed over the internet (Austerberry). Flash's compact file size resolved this issue. </p>

<p>Flash became a tool to make a website stand out. Websites would often welcome users to their site with an introductory video. Good websites would let users skip this introduction. The video wasn't necessary to inform users about the site's product or service, but soon Flash would be used for more than just animation.</p>


<p>"When Flash 4 was released in August of 1999, a programming language called ActionScript was added, as was support for data collection that could be passed on to databases or other server softwareâ€”capabilities that lent themselves to e-commerce applications. (Ankerson, 268)" Flash was no longer an animation tool; Flash could now do anything. "Macromedia's Flash vector graphics are a stepping-stone on the evolution from hypertext to rich media. The web designers and developers used a great deal of creativity and innovative scripting to make some very dynamic, interactive web sites using Flash. ...[T]hese sites now can include true streaming video and audio embedded in the animation. So by combining the production methods of the multimedia disk with the skills of the web developer, a whole new way to communicate ideas has been created. (Austerberry)" </p>

<h2>Wars of Incompatability</h2>

<p>It was the time of the Browser Wars. Browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator were in fierce competition with each other to win the majority of users. One weapon they used against one another were features. By offering features such as frames, colored backgrounds and extra text formatting browser creators hoped that the majorty of users would prefer their product (Windrum, 97). However, this was extremely hard on developers.</p>

<p>Browsers were not using the same code as one another to display webpages in order to have these special features. "...[I]ndependent content providers could in principal[sic] write versions for both browser platforms, this was an expensive option. More likely, they would choose to optimize their content for one or the other browser platforms. (Windrum, 97)" Since the code used to build websites wasn't similar, it became nescessary to find a way to develop sites for all browsers. In order to make their sites usable to more people, many content providers turned to Flash.</p>

<p>"By producing websites entirely in Flash, designers could solve the technical problem of 'cross browser compatibility' by creating a single website that displayed uniformly across multiple browser versions. Furthermore, the vector files Flash created made full-screen, high-resolution motion graphics possible for a fraction of the file size as a bitmapped images - which meant the technology could be used to efficiently deliver a rich media experience to modem users.... Unlike HTML, Flash offered total control over typography and screen space. (Ankerson, 263)" Many users could experience these rich-media sites since Flash was available to so many people. Companys could have an impressive display for their services, and designers had the ability to make whatever they wanted.</p>

<h2>The Web as a Canvas</h2>

<p>"The widespread circulation of personal experimental spaces like this generated genuine
excitement for the possibilities invoked by these new ways of visually representing and
interacting with screen space. (Ankerson, 271)"</p>
