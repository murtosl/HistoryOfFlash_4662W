<h2>Career Thoughts</h2>
  <p><ul>
    <li>I realize you are one cheap lady, but you really should join STC.</li>
    <li>Take one of your cross-department courses in management; even if it's not knowledge management. You might not want to be in charge of people's careers, but you will end up in charge of various other things.</li>
    <li>You have made the comment several times 'I am not a designer'. That is now invalid; it is certainly not your strong point so it is something you need to focus on improving.</li>
    <li>"If you specialize or work for one company, I think you havea shot at staying current in whatever your area happens to be. As a freelancer, I was expected to know any and all software and hardware at whatever organization I was working with on a particular day, as well as to understand or at least have a rudimentary grasp of tasks and concepts that were not my job but were pertinent to it." <br/>
    I find it hard to picture finding the best way to speak to your users and help them understand stuff if you don't understand how the company or employees work best because your jumping jobs. There's a big structure at each workplace, and I think being deeply involved with that is key to being successful in the position.</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <h2>Thesis Ideas</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>It would be interesteding to do a case study of wiki vs other website vs random files vs whatever as the core format of internal documentation. That being said, a technology is not always best in every team or every type of use. The focus may want to be turned more towards WHEN a certain format is better than IF a certain format is better. Otherwise the end result will be 'there is no winner.'</li>
      <li>If I want to get weird and somewhat unrelated it might be interesting to look at the use of HipChat and Slack in the workplace as a tool of communication. You could even tie in like, VictorOps for incident reports.</li>
      <li>Actually, the documentation of incident reporting might be interesting. VictorOps published their reports of on-call and it's not looked into very much. That might be very interesting.</li>
<li>video documentation vs written<\li>
    </ul></p>
    
  <h2>Snarky Thoughts</h2>
  <p><ul>
    <li>I realize most people probably major in English and then get stuck in technical writing, thus being dissapointed. But I really have problems viewing this as a 'creative' career; I view it more as educational or closer to management depending on the task. You do what's needed to inform and keep informed. Perhaps if you view it from a purely writing perspective, I can see hoping for more flexibilty, but at the end of the day the job is very user-focused, not focused on your personal ideas.</li>
    <li>"When you stop caring, itâ€™s time to get out." It's weird to me to actually care quite deeply about what I'm learning. I never really felt that before. And at some point, I'm sure that will fade, but it will be nice for now.</li>
    <li>"So many untrained professionals are doing technical writing and getting by. So why would a company that employs such an individual ever see the [techincal] writer as more than a glorified secretary?" Which is why you can't view the job as being a writer. You are not a SME, the person who developed the product is. You will NEVER understand the product as well as them; they need to explain how it works. You need to make sure their explaination is accessible and clear to others, and that chunks of knowledge aren't missing. Writing is the method of communication at the end of the day, but it is not the main purpose of your job. Furthermore, no people probably won't see what you do is valuble until things go wrong and they need the information NOW.  Like most emergency planning, it's in the back of the mind and easily ignored until there's actually a need for it. And your job is to make sure it's there. <br/>This has been Sarah Argues with her Reading Assignment.</li>
    <li>I have decided one day I will write a book called "When to properly punch your computer." It will discuss debugging and rage.</li>
    <li>Why do I need to be in read mode, and make sure I have the select tool selected in Adobe Reader to copy pdf-highlighted text? Why are you still letting me highlight text in read mode?? Because, technology. https://forums.adobe.com/thread/900768</li>
