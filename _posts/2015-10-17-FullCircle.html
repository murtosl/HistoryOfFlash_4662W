<h2>Fitting the Needs</h2>

<p>Flash has made the internet more usable throughout the years. It originally filled the need for a compact, online animation player. It then fit the need for creative websites and cross-browser compatibility. It met the need for streaming videos online. </p>

<p>But what does the internet need now?</p>

<p>Flash started as a praised third-party plug-in and was ultimately eliminated because it was a third-party plug-in. The companies who have owned and developed Flash over the years have successfully moved to meet the needs of the internet. But Flash has never been a built-in web standard. It will always be a product owned by a third-party, and it cannot escape from that.</p>

<p>Web standards and technology have finally reached a point where a third-party tool isn't necessary to make the internet work.</p>

<p>And that's what the internet needs.</p>
