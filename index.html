<p>There is a paper here. But I start by typing to myself:</p>

<p>I am torn on what to do here. I like the skip intro idea. It means the project requirements of intergrated principles we learned about into the design of the project, even if they're terrible.</p>

<p>But I changed the order of how I was going to write the paper where skip intro isn't mentioned until well into the paper. It's very disconnected that way. I want to talk plug-ins first; I absolutely need to talk market saturation first. It's kinda stuck in it's organziation. That's horrifically mispelled, but amuses me.</p>

<p>Anyways, I worry about the 'hahaha install a plugin' idea because that's going to scare someone and that is taking it too far. I don't need people to come to my site and think I'm installing things. It's 95% text.</p>

<p>So I don't know if I should still put the skip intro at the first page. I probably should; it's an intro. But I dislike it not being as smoothly connected with the project.  I can't really intergrate Flash into my design because my site wouldn't work. And I'm focusing on usability over time. So it's kinda a catch 22.</p>

<p>This did not help me come up with new thoughts. It just made my index page look useful.</p>
