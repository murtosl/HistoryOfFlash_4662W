				<p class="quote goLeft">"Flash video is an amazing feature. I'm blown away that they were able to achieve the quality and functionality they did while still keeping the Flash Player download size small. Flash video has revolutionized video on the Internet, reaching a wider audience than any other video format. It seamlessly integrates the video experience with the surrounding page and creates a killer user experience overall, blowing away the competition."
<br/> <span class="quoteName">- Darron Schall <span class="smallCite">(Balkan et al.)</span> </p>

<p class="quote goRight">"Flash was created during the PC era -- for PCs and mice. Flash is a successful business for Adobe, and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs. But the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards -- all areas where Flash falls short....New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too)." <br/><span class="quoteName">- Steve Jobs <span class="smallCite">(Jobs)</span></p>

<p>
Over the past 20 years, Flash moved from a key, third-party web component needed to view many websites, to being replaced by built-in web standards. Flash has gone on quite the journey with the ups and downs of web development, and made the internet more usable until the internet grew to not need it anymore.
