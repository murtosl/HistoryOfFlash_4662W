				<h2>A Circle of Life</h2>

<p>Flash has been used throughout the years to make the internet more usable. It was originally filled the need for a compact, online animation player. It then fit the need for creative websites and cross-browser compatibility. It then gave most web users the ability stream videos online. And then the web moved on.</p>

<p>Flash started as a praised third-party plug-in was ultimately eliminated because it was a third-party plug-in. The companies who have owned and developed Flash over the years have successfully moved with the changes needed on the internet. But Flash has never been a built-in web standard, even if the people using it as a tool treated it like it was. It will always be a product owned by a third-party, and it cannot escape from that.</p>

<p>Web standards and technology have finally reached a point where a third-party tool isn't necessary to make the internet work.</p>
<p>And that's what the internet needs.</p>
