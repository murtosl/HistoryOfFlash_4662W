				<h2>HTML5 - The Way of the Future</h2>
 
<p>In late 2011, a year and a half past Adobe and Apple's public feud, Adobe ceded to HTML5. The company stopped developing Flash for mobile devices (Goldman).</p>
 
<p class="blockquote">"HTML5 is now universally supported on major mobile devices, in some cases exclusively," wrote Danny Winokur, Adobe's general manager of interactive development.... "This makes HTML5 the best solution for creating and deploying content in the browser across mobile platforms." (Goldman)</p>

<p>It was expected that 90% of mobile browsers would be HTML5 enabled by 2013 (Goldman). Adobe would still focus Flash on the PC market for gaming and video, but soon major video services would begin moving away from supporting Flash to focusing on HTML5.</p>

<p>YouTube changed their video player to default to HTML5 in January 2015. While YouTube will still use Flash if HTML5 is not available, Flash is not a priority anymore (Paul). Flash is not quite dead, but it is on the way out, "Flash video looks prepared to survive with online advertising, smaller video sites, and YouTube visitors who aren't using a modern browser. (Paul)". Netflix has also moved to streaming video through HTML5 rather than Microsoft Silverlight. Hulu still uses Flash and has not moved to HTML5 yet, but is expected to eventually.</p>

<h2>A Return to Animation</h2> 

<p>In the wake of these changes, Adobe has returned to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html">marketing Flash as an animation tool</a>. Flash animation is still heavily used, even outside of the web. TV Shows are currently being made with Flash,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Flash_animated_television_series"> many of which are listed in this Wikipedia article</a>. Popular Flash-based series, such as <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/main11.html" target=_blank>Homestar Runner</a>, may need to change how they're currently running their website, but not necessarily their animation style. </p>

<p>Speaking of Homestar Runner, in the below video are some thoughts on Flash, in an HTML5 embedded YouTube video of a Flash animation. <span class="smallCite">(Flash Is Dead!!)</span></p> <!-- It is not often one gets to cite Homestar Runner in their grad school paper. -->
