				<h2>FutureSplash and the Start of Web Animation</h2>
 
 <p>It all began with plug-ins.</p>
 
 <p>In early 1996, Netscape Navigator released the ability for developers to create tools that the user manually had to install to customize the browsing experience. Features like video and sound players were now possible. However, in the era of dial up, computers and internet connections simply couldn't handle such advanced technology. Macromedia's Shockwave player, for instance, "caused web pages to run very slowly and required users to go into their computer preferences and bump up [Netscape] Navigator's RAM requirements so that Shockwave sites would run without error. Needless to say, this was well beyond the capabilities of the average first-time web surfer (Ankerson, 261)." Something more lightweight was needed.</p>
 
 <p>In the summer of 1996, a San Diego based startup named FutureWave Software Inc. created an animation tool called FutureSplash Animator. Originally intended to be used with a failed pen-based operating system, FutureWave Software found themselves without a home for their newly developed an animation tool (Ankerson, 323). The program was retooled for existing computer systems and a plug-in to view animations was made for Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer ("MSN"). This technology was quickly picked up by major companies, such as Microsoft's new internet channel MSN, hoping to add animation to their websites.</p>
 
 <p>"'MSN is committed to using the best Internet technologies to build entertaining multimedia Web pages for our customers. FutureSplash Animator is not only easy to use, but the small file sizes mean that we can give our members a richer online experience with graphics and animation,' said Tom Firman, director of technology for the Microsoft Network.("MSN")" The small file size and easy access of the program was very appealing to companies. "Vector-based drawings and animations can be embedded in Web pages using FutureSplash Player. This new player technology allows consumers to view drawings and animations even over a conventional modem line." ("MSN")</p>
 
 <p>Macromedia purchased FutureWave Software Inc. in January, 1997, giving them ownership of FutureSplash Animator. "Rather than develop Internet-specific multimedia technology from scratch, Macromedia folded FutureSplash into its product line, calling it Macromedia Flash. Macromedia has positioned Flash as a low-end tool and expects developers to continue to use Shockwave for more advanced interactive development (Levitt)."</p>
